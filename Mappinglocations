# Mapping Technology Resources in Cambridge

Technology platforms are labs, which develop and maintain technologies. They facilitate access and provide training and advice. There is currently an equipment database, which collects information on equipment. They provide a simple text file including the lab location.

We would like to develop a way to map the locations and also the technologies provided, as well as the platform manager contact details.

## Options:
1. A good way is the batchgeo site:

2. Google Maps is less attractive visually, but contains the option to find directions between locations.
