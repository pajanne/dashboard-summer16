## Project description

### Dashboard project with Anne
The dashboard project is about having a web page summarizing metrics of the sequencing service at the current time that evolves over time.

The sequencing service runs different Illumina platforms: HiSeq4000, HiSeq2500, MiSeq and NextSeq. For each run on a sequencer, metrics are recorded into a database which is part of the LiMS system and could be extracted and then plotted.

The first metrics to look at are yield and Q30. They should be displayed using box plots on a monthly basis.
