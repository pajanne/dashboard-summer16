## Project description

### Dashboard project with Anne
The dashboard project is about having a web page summarizing metrics of the sequencing service. The sequencing service has different Illumina sequencers: HiSeq4000, HiSeq2500, MiSeq and NextSeq, for each run on a sequencer metrics are recorded and could be plotted.
The first to look at is the yield.
